Essential Git and GitHub interview questions and answers tailored for freshers, covering the basics with clear explanations.
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Git?
Answer: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development. It helps in collaborating, reverting changes, and managing code history efficiently.
ðŸ”¹ 2. What is GitHub?
Answer: GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories. It allows developers to store code online, collaborate with others, and manage projects using features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions.
ðŸ”¹ 3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Answer:
Git	GitHub
Version control tool	Hosting service for Git repositories
Works offline	Requires internet to access
Command-line tool	Web-based GUI with additional features
ðŸ”¹ 4. What are the basic Git commands every developer should know?
Answer:
git init â€“ Initialize a new Git repository
git clone â€“ Copy a remote repository
git add â€“ Add changes to staging
git commit â€“ Save changes with a message
git push â€“ Upload local changes to GitHub
git pull â€“ Download changes from GitHub
git status â€“ Show status of changes
git log â€“ View commit history
ðŸ”¹ 5. What is a repository in Git?
Answer: A repository (repo) is a project folder where Git tracks all changes. It can be local (on your system) or remote (hosted on GitHub).
ðŸ”¹ 6. What is the purpose of git init?
Answer: git init initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It sets up the structure Git needs to track your project.
ðŸ”¹ 7. What is the difference between git add and git commit?
Answer: 
git add stages your changes.
git commit saves the staged changes with a commit message.
ðŸ”¹ 8. What is a commit in Git?
Answer: A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point. It includes a message that describes the changes made.
ðŸ”¹ 9. What is a branch in Git?
Answer: A branch is a separate line of development. The default branch is usually main or master. Developers use branches to work on features independently before merging into the main code.
ðŸ”¹ 10. What is a pull request (PR)?
Answer: A pull request is a GitHub feature used to propose changes to a repository. Team members can review and discuss the code before it is merged into the main branch.
ðŸ”¹ 11. How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?
Answer: When two branches modify the same part of a file, Git cannot merge them automatically. To resolve:
Open the conflicting file
Edit the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
Save the corrected version
Use git add and git commit to finalize
ðŸ”¹ 12. What is the .gitignore file?
Answer:.gitignore file tells Git which files or directories to ignore and not track. Useful for excluding files like node_modules, .env, or logs.
ðŸ”¹ 13. What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?
Answer: 
git fetch: Downloads changes but doesn't merge them automatically
git pull: Fetches and merges changes into your current branch
ðŸ”¹ 14. What is forking in GitHub?
Answer: Forking means creating a personal copy of someone else's repository. It allows you to experiment or make changes without affecting the original project.
ðŸ”¹ 15. How can you revert a commit?
Answer: Use git revert <commit_id> to undo a specific commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes.
